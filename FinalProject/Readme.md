# Introduction
The aim of this project is to design a Tic-tac-toe game with server-client
architecture. Tic-tac-toe, a classic and simple game for two players, is
traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their distinct
symbol, an 'X' or 'O', in the grid's cells, with the goal to place three of their
marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. In this project you have to
implement 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 boards and each player connects the
corresponding player with the same selection on the board size. (3x3 and
4x4 boards need 3 connected houses and 5x5 board need 4 connected
houses)
